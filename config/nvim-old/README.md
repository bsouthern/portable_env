# This is my fuckin neovim now! But thanks Chris...

## Get healthy

Open `nvim` and enter the following:

```
:checkhealth
```

## Changes

v mode intent shortcuts. Need to add this to normal mode too.

Eventually I need to start working in portable_env, and installing into my env. Otherwise I have to constantly move changes from local config to git.
